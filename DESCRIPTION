Description: Build systems such as 'Travic-CI' have many ways to notify
    users when jobs have completed including posting a message to an IRC
    channel. In similar form, there are many times when analyses
    or data cleaning/processing operations are long running tasks that
    operate in the background or on remote systems. Functions are provided
    to notify users of the status of these tasks via IRC.
